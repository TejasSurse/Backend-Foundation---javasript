Understanding Backend and front end best practices 

-- professional way to read api - 
    json formater - go in tree structure 

write - backend in full stack application 

there are toolchain - (writing way of frontend i.e - some peoples use vite , some use creat-react-app)

toochain - bundlers 

- now we are using bundler - vite ( server html css js)
to browser 

axios is comes with some over the top or better features than fetch 
this library specially writeen for web request with all states 

CORS - provides safety to applications 
allow and disallow 

gharat - family allow - other not allow

CORS - cross origin 


cross origin means - bend - 3000 fend 5000 they are cross origin 

url diff - cross origin 


ip whitelist or domain whitelist 

-- sol 1 backend - install cors and allow 

read cors docs 

Proxy - search proxy 

-- package.json 
    "proxy" : "url" for create react app
    there are different ways for proxy 

vite -

    vite.config.js
        - 



very bad practice 
-- pushing backend folder and frontend folder on same deployment 

-- can test 
-- npm run build 


hence always segregate fend and backend
