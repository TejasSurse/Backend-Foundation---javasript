pc ------ server
communtion previous 
client - > req server get req and 
send res -> res

it. 
req -> res close 

then agian 
req -> res close

this is problem is once req it gives res and 
it always closes connection 


communication is only single direction

-----------------------------------

Problem is 
if we are server one is client and another is client and we want to makke chatting application real time 

if user want to send message to other user
he send to server then then another user recieves message from server but not good i.e everyon has to check is there any message 

========

user 1 ---- server ---- user 2
       ---- server ---- user 3


this thing is knonw as polling but it is over kill 

i.e 1000s of client if pooling hence server load increases 

 in socket 


 user 1 ----- server ( make https req send and make connection )

 if server accept connection then

 i.e http req sended by user converted to socket by server

 so it makes bidirectional communication  

 once connection is made then it is not closed unless you want 



 client 1 ----- server ------ user 2

 it is bidirectional communication beacuse connectioon is not closed

 reaad -- MDN - upgrade 

 socket io
